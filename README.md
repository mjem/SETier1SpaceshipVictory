Space-Exploration Tier-1 Victory
================================

Introduction
------------

This mod allows players to complete the Space Exploration Spaceship Victory and the Krastorio 2 victory condition using only Tier 1 space sciences. This substantially shortens the time to achieve either victory while still needing many interesting Space Exploration challenges. This mod works by removing tech prerequisites, simplifying recipes and reducing required amounts of some items. It also removes the requirement to complete the Krastorio 2 victory first so players can choose to take the spaceship victory directly.

Higher tier sciences are still available for players to complete after these victory conditions to get access to very powerful late game technology and items.

You still have to complete most of the key objectives of SE mod - building multiple outposts on other worlds, creating all the prerequisites and ingredients for all the T1 sciences, setting up interplanetary logistics, arcosphere folding. 

Requirements for some raw meterials like rocket fuel, offworld plates and naquim processing are all reduced to allow vicctory conditons with smaller and less optimised factories, although the normal set of offworld colonies are all required including naquim mining.

However you won't need some of the more advanced techniques - arcosphere folding, asteroid, solar and star probes probes, advanced buildings and energy beaming and glaves

Tier 2, 3 and 4 sciences and above are still present and players can of course continue and obtain higher level techs and items.

Other mods
----------

Krastorio 2 is a hard requirement for installing this mod.

For other mods I recommend see the aotho modpack: <url>.

Some of the functionality of this mod used to be in SENoMoreRocketMan in older versions although they are now independant.

Non planned enhancements
------------------------

- Launch tower to be built next to a spaceship launch site to reduce fuel cost to make orbital transport ships more practical
- Alternative rocket booster that combines an initial launcher, small fuel tank and low powered thruster to help build small orbital transports.
- Solar sails for spaceships that travel close to the sun
